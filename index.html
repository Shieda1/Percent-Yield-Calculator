    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the percent yield<br> 
    What is the percent yield?<br>
    The percent yield is a measurement of the quantity of moles of a specific product formed in relation to the reactant consumed in a chemical reaction and it is usally expressed as a percentage> It is also called reaction yield.<br>
    How to calculate percent yield?<br>
    To calculate percent yield you should use the following formula:<br>
    percent yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100%<br>
    Example: In a chemical reaction, 1g of product is made the calculated yield is 3.5g, calculate the percent yield calculator?<br>
    Using the percent yield formula the answer will be:<br>
    percent yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100%<br>
    percent yield = (1 / 3.5) * 100%<br>
    percent yield = 28.57%<br>
    Why use percent yield?<br>
    The percent yield is used to compare the yield of product acutally obtained with the amount that could have been obtained in theory.<br>
